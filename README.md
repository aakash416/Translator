HTML, CSS: Used for structuring the web page and styling the user interface for an intuitive user experience.

JavaScript: Utilized to handle user interactions, fetch data from the Google Translate API, and display translated text dynamically.

Google Translate API: Integrated to perform translation from general Hindi to the selected dialects in real-time.

# Process Description:

Translation: Google Translate API translates the input text into the selected dialect.

Display Translation: The translated text is received from the API response and dynamically displayed on the web page below the input area.

User Interaction: Users can continue to enter new text and click the "Translate" button to see translations in different dialects.
